      "text": "$(thing)Ovens$() are a great way of cooking lots of food in a way that improves their shelf life. Oven-baked food decays at 90% of the rate of regular food. Ovens are a multiblock structure consisting of a $(thing)Bottom Oven$(), $(thing)Top Oven$(), and optionally $(thing)Chimneys$(). These blocks start off as clay, and must be $(thing)Cured$() by raising their temperature to a certain amount for long enough."

Placing a stack of chimneys directly behind the oven causes the smoke from the oven to travel up and out of it. If you don't do this, smoke will quickly fill up your house, which is very distracting!"
